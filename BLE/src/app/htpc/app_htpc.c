 * @brief Start the Health Thormometer Collector profile - at connection. *//**
 * @param[in] hts           HTS details.
 * @param[in] conhdl        Connection handle for which the profile Collector role is enabled.
 * @response  HTPC_ENABLE_CFM
 * @description  
 *
 * This API is used by Application to send message to TASK_HTPC for enabling the Collector role 
 * of the Health Thermometer profile, and it contains the connection handle for the connection this 
 * profile is activated, the connection type and the previously saved discovered HTS details on peer. 
 * 
 * The connection type may be 0 = Connection for discovery/initial configuration or 1 = Normal 
 * connection. This difference has been made and Application would handle it in order to not 
 * discover the HTS on the Thermometer at every connection, but do it only once and keep the 
 * discovered details in the Collector device between connections.  Configuration can be done 
 * during a normal connection also, but since most use cases allow Thermometer to disconnect 
 * the link once all measurements have been sent to Collector, the Collector may not have the 
 * time for it.
 *  
 * If it is a discovery /configuration type of connection, the hts and dis parameters are useless, 
 * they will be filled with 0's. Otherwise they will contain pertinent data which will be kept in the 
 * Collector environment while enabled. It allows for the Application to not be aware of attribute 
 * details. 
 *    
 * For a normal connection, the response to this request is sent right away after saving the HTS 
 * and DIS content in the environment and registering HTPC in GATT to receive the indications 
 * and notifications for the known attribute handles in HTS that would be notified/indicated. For a 
 * discovery connection, discovery of the peer HTS is started and the response will be sent at the 
 * end of the discovery with the discovered attribute details.
