 * @brief Start the Blood Pressure Collector profile - at connection. *//**
 * @param[in] bps           Blood Pressure Service Content Structure.
 * @param[in] conhdl        Connection handle for which the profile blood pressure collector role is enabled.
 * @response  BLPC_ENABLE_CFM
 * @description
 *
 *  This API is used for enabling the Collector role of the Blood Pressure profile. This Function 
 *  contains BLE connection handle, the connection type and the previously saved discovered BPS and DIS 
 *  details on peer. 
 *
 *  The connection type may be 0 = Connection for discovery/initial configuration or 1 = Normal connection. This 
 *  parameter is used by Application to discover peer device services once at first connection. Application shall save those 
 *  information to reuse them for other connections. During normal connection, previously discovered device 
 *  information can be reused.
 *
 *  This is usefull since most use cases allow Bood Pressure Sensor to disconnect the link once all measurements have 
 *  been sent to Collector.
 *
 *  If it is a discovery /configuration type of connection, the BPS and DIS parameters are useless, they will be filled with 
 *  0's. 
 *
 *  Otherwise they will contain pertinent data which will be kept in the Collector environment while enabled. It allows for 
 *  the Application to not be aware of attribute details. 
 *
 *  For a normal connection, the response to this request is sent right away after saving the BPS and DIS content in the 
 *  environment and registering BLPC in GATT to receive the indications and notifications for the known attribute handles
 *  in BPS that would be notified/indicated. For a discovery connection, discovery of the peer BPS and DIS is started and 
 *  the response will be sent at the end of the discovery with the discovered attribute details.

 *  When the peer has responded to GATT, and the response is routed to BLPC, the BLPC_RD_CHAR_RSP message will be 
 *  generically built and the Application must be able to interpret it based on the read request it made. And error status 
 *  is also possible either for the Read procedure or for the application request, in the second case, the BLPC_ERROR_IND
