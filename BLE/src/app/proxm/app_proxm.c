 * @brief Start the Proximity Monitor profile - at connection. *//**
 * @param[in] lls           Link Loss Service information.
 * @param[in] ias           Immediate Alert Service information.
 * @param[in] txps          Tx Power Service information.
 * @param[in] conhdl        Connection handle for which the profile Monitor role is enabled.
 * @response  PROXM_ENABLE_CFM or PROXM_ERROR_IND
 * @description
 *
 *  The API is used for enabling the Monitor role of the Proximity profile. 
 *  This function contains the connection handle for the connection this profile is 
 *  activated, the connection type and the previously saved discovered LLS, IAS and TPS details 
 *  on peer. 
 *
 *  The connection type may be 0 = Connection for discovery or 1 = Normal connection. This 
 *  difference has been made and Application would handle it in order to not discover the 
 *  attributes on the Reporter at every connection, but do it only once and keep the discovered 
 *  details in the Monitor device between connections. 
 *
 *  If it is a discovery type connection, the LLS, IAS and TPS parameters are useless, they will be 
 *  filled with 0's. Otherwise it will contain pertinent data which will be kept in the Monitor 
 *  environment while enabled. It allows for the Application to not be aware of attribute details, 
 *  and only give them to the profile role from a storage area where they are kept in between 
 *  connections (NVDS...). 
 *
 *  For a normal connection, the response to this request is sent right away after saving the lls, ias 
 *  and tps content in the environment. For a  discovery  connection, discovery of the peer 
 *  attributes is started and the response will be sent at the end of the discovery with the 
 *  discovered attribute details. The discovery starts with the 3 services, then with the 
 *  characteristics of the discovered services. If an error happens during discovery (mandatory 
 *  conditions present in the specification are not respected - missing services, mandatory 
 *  characteristics...) it is signaled right away to the application setting an appropriate value in the 
 *  status parameter of the response.

 *
 *  This API is used by the application to set either a LLS Alert Level or an 
 *  IAS Alert Level. Since these two service have characteristics of the same type (but not the 
 *  same properties - LLS one is R&W, IAS one is Write no Response only), one API message for a 
 *  very similar purpose was considered sufficient, and therefore a simple byte for differentiating 
 *  whether the alert code should be set in LLS or IAS characteristic is used.
 *
 *  Upon reception of this request, the connection handle is checked, then the alert level to set in 
 *  order to ensure a valid value, and then the svc_code for 0 or 1.. In case any of these checks 
 *  fail, a PROXM_ERROR_IND message is sent to the Application with error code 0x01.
 *
 *  If the checks are successful, a write characteristic request is build for TASK_GATT, with the 
 *  appropriate type (Simple Write or Write no response) and using the characteristic handle for 
 *  the service indicated by svc_code. When the Write Response is received from TASK_GATT, it is 
 *  sent to the Application for it to check the status.
