 * @response  FINDL_ENABLE_CFM
 * @description
 *
 *  This API is used for enabling the Locator role of the Find Me profile. This 
 *  function contains the connection handle for the connection this profile is 
 *  activated, the connection type and the previously saved discovered IAS details on peer.
 *
 *  The connection type may be 0 = Connection for discovery  or 1 = Normal connection. This 
 *  difference has been made and Application would handle it in order to not discover the IAS on 
 *  the Target at every connection, but do it only once and keep the discovered details in the 
 *  Locator device between connections. 
 *  ATTENTION: Normally information about the peer should not be kept from one connection to the next if they have not 
 *  bonded!
 *
 *  If it is a discovery type connection, the IAS parameter is useless, and it will be filled with 0's. 
 *  Otherwise it will contain pertinent data which will be kept in the Locator environment while 
 *  enabled. It allows for the Application to not be aware of attribute details. For a normal 
 *  connection, the response to this request is sent right away after saving the ias content in the 
 *  environment. For a discovery connection, discovery of the peer IAS is started and the response 
 *  will be sent at the end of the discovery with the discovered attribute details.

 *
 *  This API is used by the application to trigger/stop and alert on the peer 
 *  Target device. The Locator role environment contains the attribute handle for the Alert Level 
 *  Characteristic in the IAS of the Target peer device. This way, a correct request to write this 
 *  attribute to the level requested by the application can be sent. Since the Alert Level 
 *  Characteristic in IAS can only be written using a Write No Response ATT Request, no 
 *  confirmation can be received through the profile. The only confirmation can be observed by 
 *  the user either by noticing and alarm on the Target device or the alarm stopping.
