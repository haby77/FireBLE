 * @brief SMPM Set Key request. *//**
 * @param[in] key_code     GATT request type for distinguishing between IRK and CSRK.
 *  - SMP_KDIST_IDKEY      
 *  - SMP_KDIST_SIGNKEY    
 * @param[in] key          This structure contains a 16 octet array (U8[16]) in which 
 *                         the key value from the application is written MSB to LSB 
 *                         from index 0 to 15.
 * @response  SMPM_SET_KEY_CFM
 * @description
 *
 *  This API is used by the Application to set the device keys that are unique for 
 *  the device and not connection dependent. The key_code parameter allows to use one single
 *  API message for setting either the IRK or the CSRK value ¨C 0x02 is used for IRK and 0x04
 *  for CSRK because the definitions made in SMPC used in key distribution formatting are 
 *  reused in SMPM. The value of the keys is sent from Application to SMPM in MSB to LSB format
 *  because these keys are used in the LE_Encrypt command in this format directly. Upon receiving
 *  a CSRK set request, the signature counter, also kept in the SMPM environment, will be reset
 *  to 0, and also the SMPM_GET_SUBKEYS_REQ is sent to SMPC to calculate the K1 and K2 keys needed
 *  in the signature generation algorithm, to save time when a signature will be asked from SM block.
 *  The SMPM_SET_KEY_CFM is sent to the API with a simple status and the key code value for confirming
 *  that the right key was set.
