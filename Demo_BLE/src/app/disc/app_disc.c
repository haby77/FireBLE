 * @description
 *
 *  This API is used for enabling the Client role of the Device Information Service. 
 *  The Application sends it, and it contains the connection handle for the connection this 
 *  profile is activated, the connection type and the previously saved discovered DIS details on 
 *  peer.  
 *
 *  The connection type may be 0 = Connection for discovery  or 1 = Normal connection. This 
 *  difference has been made and Application would handle it in order to not discover the DIS on 
 *  the Server at every connection, but do it only once and keep the discovered details in the 
 *  Client device between connections. 
 *
 *  If it is a discovery type connection, the DIS parameter is useless, and it will be filled with 0's. 
 *  Otherwise it will contain pertinent data which will be kept in the Client environment while 
 *  enabled. It allows for the Application to not be aware of attribute details. For a normal 
 *  connection, the response to this request is sent right away after saving the dis content in the 
 *  environment. For a discovery connection, discovery of the peer DIS is started and the response 
 *  will be sent at the end of the discovery with the discovered attribute details.

 *  - DISC_FIRM_REV_STR_CHAR

 * @param[in] conhdl        Connection handle for which the profile Locator role is enabled.
 * @response  DISC_RD_CHAR_RSP or DISC_ERROR_IND
 * @description
 *
 *  This API is used by the application to send a GATT_READ_CHAR_REQ 
 *  with the parameters deduced from the  char_code. Upon reception of this message, DISC 
 *  checks whether the parameters are correct, then if the handle for the characteristic is valid 
 *  (not 0x0000) and the request is sent to GATT.
 *
 *  When the peer has responded to GATT, and the response is routed to DISC, the 
 *  DICS_RD_CHAR_RSP message will be generically built and the Application must be able to 
 *  interpret it based on the read request it made. And error status is also possible either for the 
 *  Read procedure or for the application request, in the second case, the DISC_ERROR_IND 
 *  message is sent to Application.
 *
 *  No parsing intelligence of the received response is added in this API handler, so all the work of 
 *  interpretation must be added in the Application depending of its request and use of the 
 *  response.
