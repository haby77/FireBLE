 * @brief Start the Glucose Profile Collector - at connection.     *//**
 *
 * @param[in] gls      Existing handle values GLS (see Glucose Content Structure (struct gls_content))
 * @param[in] conhdl   Connection handle for which the profile Glucose collector role is enabled
 * @response  GLPC_ENABLE_CFM
 * @description
 *
 *  This API is used for enabling the Collector role of the Glucose profile. This function 
 *  contains BLE connection handle, the connection type and the previously saved discovered GLS details on peer. 
 *  The connection type may be 0 = Connection for discovery/initial configuration or 1 = Normal connection. This 
 *  parameter is used by Application to discover peer device services once at first connection. Application shall save those 
 *  information to reuse them for other connections. During normal connection, previously discovered device 
 *  information can be reused.
 *
 *  This is useful since most use cases allow Glucose sensor to disconnect the link once all measurements have been sent 
 *  to Collector.
 *
 *  If it is a discovery/configuration type of connection, the GLS parameters are useless, and they will be filled with 0's. 
 *  Otherwise they will contain pertinent data which will be kept in the Collector environment while enabled. It allows for 
 *  the Application to not be aware of attribute details. 
 *
 *  For a normal connection, the response to this request is sent right away after saving the GLS content in the 
 *  environment and registering GLPC in GATT to receive the indications and notifications for the known attribute handles
 *  in GLS that would be notified/indicated. For a discovery connection, discovery of the peer GLS is started and the 
 *  response will be sent at the end of the discovery with the discovered attribute details.

 *  an on-going operation (see Record Access Control Point (RACP) OP Code). This action contains a filter describing 
 *  which glucose measurement are concerned by the operation.
 *
 *  Possible OP Code: 
 *  - GLP_REQ_REP_STRD_RECS: Report stored records
 *  - GLP_REQ_REP_NUM_OF_STRD_RECS: Report number of stored records
 *  - GLP_REQ_DEL_STRD_RECS: Delete stored records
 *  - GLP_REQ_ABORT_OP: Abort on-going operation.
 *
 *  Possible Operator: 
 *  - GLP_OP_ALL_RECS
 *  - GLP_OP_LT_OR_EQ
 *  - GLP_OP_GT_OR_EQ
 *  - GLP_OP_WITHIN_RANGE_OF
 *  - GLP_OP_FIRST_REC

 *  
 *  Possible filter type: 
 *  - GLP_FILTER_SEQ_NUMBER
 *  - GLP_FILTER_USER_FACING_TIME
 *
 * @note  
 *
 *  During an on-going operation, any other request from collector shall be refused by Glucose service, except 
 *  GLP_REQ_ABORT_OP (Abort operation). In that case on-going operation shall be stopped by glucose sensor. RACP 
 *  response message shall be received from peer Glucose sensor with GLP_REQ_ABORT_OP op_code and status equals 
 *  GLP_RSP_SUCCESS.
